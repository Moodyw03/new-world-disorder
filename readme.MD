## The Concept

At New World Disorder, our vision is to redefine the norms of the fashion industry by introducing the concept of extreme exclusivity. Each t-shirt design is a limited run, making each piece a coveted collectible. This exclusivity not only enhances the value of each piece but also fosters a deeper connection between the product and its wearer.

##  Mission

Our mission is to redefine the true essence of limited edition by crafting only a very select number of t-shirts. We strive to deliver unmatched quality and one-of-a-kind designs to the fashion-conscious individual who values true exclusivity and sustainability. Our goal is to cultivate a global community of customers who appreciate the uniqueness of fashion and are passionate about expressing themselves with our rare and exceptional pieces.

The UI features a playful yet clean aesthetic with a dinosaur theme, adding a memorable touch to the shopping experience.

Key design elements include:

## Project Overview
**Scope for Django E-Commerce Web Application "New World Disorder Brand"**

The primary goal of this project is to develop an advanced e-commerce web application using Django, offering a seamless shopping experience for customers purchasing t-shirts. The website will leverage the Printful API for product fulfillment and Stripe for payment processing. Additionally, the site will feature a blog for customer engagement and a newsletter signup form for marketing purposes.

### Colour Scheme

Color Scheme and Background Design

![NWD Color Scheme](https://github.com/Moodyw03/new-world-disorder/blob/main/static/nwd%20color.png?raw=true)

For the New World Disorder (NWD) website, we've chosen a carefully curated color scheme that aligns with the site's brutalist aesthetic while ensuring it doesn't interfere with the display of our t-shirts. The color palette features a gradient background that adds a dynamic and engaging element to the site. Here’s a detailed look at the selected colors and their purpose:

Color Palette:
E1DFF4: A soft, muted lavender that serves as the primary background color.
E4E2F3: A slightly darker shade of lavender to create a subtle gradient effect.
111111: A deep, rich black used for text and important accents to maintain high contrast and readability.
E5E2F1: Another variant of light lavender to blend seamlessly in the gradient.
3C3D43: A dark grey that complements the black, adding depth and neutrality.
Gradient Background:
The gradient background transitions smoothly from E1DFF4 to E5E2F1, providing a soft and subtle movement that adds a sense of dynamism and depth to the website. This gradient is designed to give the site a sense of movement without being overwhelming, ensuring that the focus remains on the t-shirt designs.

Compatibility with T-Shirt Colors:
The selected color scheme is neutral and non-intrusive, making sure that it does not clash with or overshadow the diverse colors and designs of the t-shirts. The soft lavender tones create a calming and unobtrusive backdrop, allowing the vibrant t-shirt designs to stand out prominently.

Brutalist Style:
The brutalist style of the NWD website is characterized by its stark, functional design, and the use of the 111111 black and 3C3D43 grey enhances this aesthetic. These colors are employed for text, borders, and other elements, maintaining the clean, bold, and utilitarian look that is a hallmark of brutalist design.

By using this thoughtful color scheme and gradient background, we ensure that the NWD website remains visually appealing, dynamic, and true to its brutalist roots, while also providing an excellent showcase for our t-shirt collections.



### Typography

In the design of "newworlddisorder.shop," the choice of font plays a crucial role in reinforcing the overall aesthetic and user experience. The selected font, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace, aligns perfectly with the brutalist design style adopted for the project. Here’s why this choice is effective:

#### Consistency with Brutalist Design
Brutalism in web design is characterized by its raw, unadorned approach that focuses on functionality over form. This style often utilizes bold typography, minimalist layouts, and a stark, utilitarian appearance. 'Courier New', with its monospaced, typewriter-like appearance, embodies these principles by providing a straightforward, no-nonsense visual impact.

#### Features of 'Courier New'
1. **Monospaced Structure**: Each character in 'Courier New' occupies the same amount of horizontal space. This creates a grid-like uniformity which complements the rigid, grid-based layouts typical of brutalist design.
2. **Legibility**: The clean, unembellished design of 'Courier New' ensures high legibility, making it easier for users to read text content without distractions. This is particularly important in brutalist designs, where clarity and function are paramount.
3. **Retro Aesthetic**: 'Courier New' evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of old typewriters and early computer interfaces. This retro feel can enhance the brutalist design by adding an element of timelessness and authenticity.

#### Why 'Courier New' Works with Brutalist Style
1. **Visual Contrast**: Brutalist designs often employ high contrast and stark visual elements. 'Courier New' provides a strong contrast against backgrounds, especially when used in conjunction with bold color schemes and minimalistic elements.
2. **Simplicity and Directness**: The straightforward appearance of 'Courier New' aligns with the brutalist ethos of prioritizing content and user interaction over decorative elements. It communicates information clearly and directly, which is the core intention of brutalist design.
3. **Cohesive Aesthetic**: By using 'Courier New', the website maintains a cohesive aesthetic that resonates with the brutalist philosophy. The font's mechanical and functional look integrates seamlessly with the overall design, enhancing the user experience by maintaining a consistent visual language.

The decision to use 'Courier New', Courier, monospace in "newworlddisorder.shop" underscores a commitment to the principles of brutalist design. Its monospaced, legible, and retro characteristics contribute to a clear, functional, and visually striking website. This choice not only enhances readability and user experience but also firmly establishes the site’s aesthetic identity within the brutalist design paradigm.

## Integration of Printful.com and Stripe APIs with Django for New World Disorder

## Using Printful API

Printful.com is an on-demand order fulfillment and warehousing service that supports businesses in printing and shipping products such as t-shirts directly to customers. Here's how Printful can be integrated into the Django project for "New World Disorder":

### Product Sync
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Automatically sync new t-shirt designs from the Django application to the Printful product catalog.

### Order Fulfillment
- **Automated Processing**: When a customer purchases a t-shirt, the order details are automatically sent from Django to Printful, which then handles the printing, packing, and shipping.

### Stock Management
- **Inventory Updates**: Use the Printful API to track and update inventory levels to ensure that no more than 33 pieces of each design are sold.

### Shipping and Handling
- **Logistics Integration**: Retrieve shipping options, calculate costs, and provide tracking information through the API.

## Using Stripe API

Stripe is a robust platform for handling online payments, which can be integrated into Django to facilitate secure and efficient transactions:

### Payment Processing
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Handle payments through various methods, accommodating a wide range of customers.

### Security
- **Data Protection**: Stripe manages credit card data storage and processing, significantly reducing compliance burdens with PCI DSS.

### Subscription Management
- **Recurring Billing**: If subscriptions or priority ordering for repeat customers are offered, Stripe can manage these processes.

## Implementation in Django

Here's a general approach to implementing these APIs within a Django framework:

### API Keys
- Obtain API keys by registering with Printful and Stripe.

### Install Libraries
- Use pip to install necessary libraries like `printful`, `dj-stripe`, or `stripe`.

### Configure Settings
- Add configurations such as API keys in `settings.py` and set up webhook endpoints.

### Create Models
- Define models to store product, order, and transaction information. Extend pre-built models from `dj-stripe` as necessary.

### Develop Views/Controllers
- Implement views to handle API interactions like order creation, payment processing, or stock updates.

### Secure Transactions
- Ensure all transactions are secure and comply with web security standards.

### Testing
